# Resume-Builder

A simple, responsive resume/CV builder that lets users fill in their details and generate a printable/resumable resume. This project is primarily built with CSS and HTML, with a small Python component for optional backend/export functionality.

Repository: https://github.com/piyush2004parate/Resume-Builder

## Features

- Clean, responsive resume layout designed with HTML and CSS
- Live preview of the resume as you fill in details (client-side)
- Print-friendly styles for PDF export using browser print or print-to-PDF
- Optional Python backend for advanced export (if present in the repo)

## Tech stack

- CSS (primary) — styling and responsive layout
- HTML — structure and forms
- Python (optional) — backend utilities or export scripts

## Quick demo / Usage

There are two common ways to run the project locally:

1. Static preview (no server required)
   - Clone the repo:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/piyush2004parate/Resume-Builder.git
     cd Resume-Builder
     ```
   - Open `index.html` in your browser to preview and use the builder.

2. Serve locally with a simple HTTP server (recommended for form POSTs or local fetch)
   - Python 3 (from the project root):
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

3. Optional Python backend (if the repository contains a backend application)
   - If there is a backend folder or an `app.py` and a `requirements.txt`, install dependencies and run the app:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     python app.py
     ```
   - Follow the backend README or console output for routes and usage.

## How to use

- Open the builder in your browser (index.html or served URL).
- Fill in the form fields: personal details, summary, experience, education, skills.
- Use the preview pane to see formatting in real-time.
- To export to PDF, use your browser’s Print dialog (File → Print → Save as PDF). The project includes print-friendly CSS to improve PDF output.

## Customization

- Modify styling in the CSS files (e.g., `styles.css`) to change fonts, colors, spacing, or layout.
- Update HTML templates to add or remove sections.
- Add more export options (e.g., server-side PDF generation) if you include or build a Python backend using libraries like WeasyPrint, wkhtmltopdf, ReportLab, or Playwright.

## Accessibility & Printing tips

- Use semantic HTML elements and accessible form labels for better screen reader support.
- Test print layout with different browser print scales; adjust page-break rules in CSS for long sections.
